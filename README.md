Supports CommonJS. ES6 imports support coming.

Description
-----------

`hawthorn` is a static analyzer that can build a dependency tree data structure
out of a JavaScript project by recursively parsing and scanning for `require()`
calls (and ES6 imports in the future).

Installation
------------

The easiest way to use `hawthorn` is with its example CLI that you can install
with:

```sh
npm install --global hawthorn
```

The CLI takes a `--directory`/`-d` option which is the base directory of the
project you want to scan, and one or more glob patterns to use as entry points
(defaults to `lib/**/*.js`).

You can test `hawthorn` on itself by running:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jviotti/hawthorn.git
$ hawthorn --directory ./hawthorn 'lib/*.js' > tree.json
```

See an example of the generated output here:
https://github.com/jviotti/hawthorn/blob/master/example.json.

Documentation
-------------

If you install `hawthorn` as a dependency, you can `require('hawthorn')` and
the module will export a top level function that takes an array of path globs,
an options object, and resolves a JavaScript object with the resulting
dependency tree.

### `hawthorn(String[] paths, Object options) -> Object`

The available options are:

- `directory`: The base directory to use when scanning. Should be usually set
  to the root directory of the project you want to scan

Example:

```js
const hawthorn = require('hawthorn')
const tree = hawthorn([
  'lib/**/*.js'
], {
  directory: '~/projects/hawthorn'
})
```
